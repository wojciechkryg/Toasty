# Toasty
Simply application which shows sms message as toast.

It is useful when you are texting with someone and simultaneously doing something else on your phone. With this app you do not have to open immediately your sms app, but you can read the whole message and send back message after you have done something that you were doing.
For example you can watch movie on YouTube or play game and message would be shown as a toast.
